# Version 2.5.4

- Added Solo Importing: Now you can import your chats inside the "Saved Messages" section of your Telegram account.
- Now the file that is being imported will be locked while the app is working with it, so you don't accidentally delete it or remove it, crashing the app.
- Fixed typos
- Improved overall performance.
- Fancy colors that make the app beautiful and friendlier :)
- An even fancier progress bar that will keep you updated of the progress
- Added an "--advanced" command line parameter that will display detailed output while importing into Telegram, confirming you every time that a message has been sent.
- Better error handling.
