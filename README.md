# TLImporter - Telegram Chat Importer
## A tiny app that will import your chats from WhatsApp or other third-party services into Telegram

| |![](/images/TLImporter.svg)|

This app aims to import into Telegram your conversations from WhatsApp or other services, keeping the original structure. It works by reading a _txt_ file (obtained in your old chat provider first) and looking for the messages sent by each one of both partners. The app will ask you to log in two Telegram's users ("User 1" and "User 2") in order to import each message, following their original structure.

### How do I get my chats in TXT to be imported?

Every chat service has its own way of exporting your conversations. Read the FAQs of your chat provider for more information on how to get
your conversations in a text file. In this guide, I will show you how to get them from one of the biggest messagging apps: *WhatsApp*

First, open your chat | Tap the top of the Chat to access your partner's info | Send the e-mail to yourself |

Those messages are the ones that you are going to import into Telegram | Open the menu and choose "send as e-mail | Just send the e-mail to yourself |

**Take in mind that is only possible to import messages and NOT media in Telegram Chat Importer. Media (such as photos, voice notes...) are not supported in txt files. That's why WhatsApp doesn't export them and Telegram Chat Importer can't take care of them.**

Your exported txt file will look something like this:
