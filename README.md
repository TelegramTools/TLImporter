# TLImporter - Telegram Chat Importer

This app will import your conversations from WhatsApp or other services into Telegram, keeping their original structure. It will read a _txt_ file (obtained in your old chat provider first), and then, look for who has sent each message and send it to two Telegram's accounts. If a message has been sent to your partner (or viceversa) in the original conversation, it will appear as if you have sent it in Telegram. Easy!

Briefly, Telegram Chat Importer turns your exported plaintext conversations like this:

## Credits

This couldn't be possible without [TLSharp](https://github.com/sochix/TLSharp), by sochix, and a also [TelegramClient](https://github.com/vik-borisov/TelegramClient) by vik-borisov. They both helped me during the coding of the app, but I finally went with TLSharp for the final release of this app.

Also, huge acknowledgements to Telegram for making such a great messenger!
