# TLImporter - Telegram Chat Importer

This app will import your conversations from WhatsApp or other services (using a _txt_ file obtained from the chat provider) into Telegram. With TLImporter you can import your messages into your "Saved Messages" section or do it in a 1:1 format. That means that you will need to log in your partner's Telegram's account inside TLImporter and it will automatically send the corresponding messages to each other, keeping the original structure.

Briefly, Telegram Chat Importer can turn your exported plaintext conversations into a 1:1 format like this:

## Credits

This couldn't be possible without [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon), and his great creator, [Lonami](https://github.com/Lonami), who always was up to answering questions and helping in development. I'm so grateful for his patience :).

And also without [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) which I used to build the Windows binaries.

Also, huge acknowledgements to Telegram for making such a great messenger!
