# TLImporter - Telegram Chat Importer
## A tiny app that will import your chats from WhatsApp or other third-party services into Telegram

This app aims to import into Telegram your conversations from WhatsApp or other services. It works by reading a _txt_ file (obtained in your
old chat provider first) and looking for the messages sent by each one of both partners. The app will ask you to log in two Telegram's users
(User 1 and User 2) in order to send the corresponding message to each user.
